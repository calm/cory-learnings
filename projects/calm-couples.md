# üß† Cory's Learnings & Preferences

> **Purpose**: Living document tracking Cory's preferences, decisions, feedback, and discoveries across development sessions.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-30
**Session Count**: 2

---

## üéØ Core Working Principles

### Development Philosophy

**"Do this yourself"** - Core directive (Session 1)
- Don't leave TODOs in code - complete implementations fully
- If planning something, implement it completely
- No placeholders or "we'll do this later" - do it now
- Pragmatic over theoretical (rejected iOS automation for backend database issues)

**"Be critical and continue"** - Quality mindset (Session 1)
- Perform thorough analysis before implementing
- Point out issues and fix them proactively
- Don't just follow instructions blindly - think critically
- Continue working autonomously without asking for permission at each step

**"Test all and make sure ok"** - Quality assurance (Session 1)
- Comprehensive testing is non-negotiable
- Run tests and verify they pass before moving on
- Fix all errors, don't leave broken tests
- 63/63 tests passing is the standard

**"Do next todo"** - Autonomous execution (Session 2)
- Work through task lists without constant check-ins
- Use judgment to handle blocked items (migrations) and move to next actionable task
- Trust the plan and execute efficiently

### Code Quality Standards

**Versioning**:
- "start making important versioning as applicable" (Session 1)
- Add version tracking where it matters (optimistic locking, race conditions)
- Version field added to Plant interface per this directive

**Structured Logging**:
- Prefers logger over console.log (discovered through PR review)
- All errors should be structured with component, action, metadata
- 19 console statements migrated to logger in Session 2

**Documentation**:
- Loves comprehensive documentation (AGENTS.md pattern from calm/api)
- Wants AI agents to understand codebase architecture
- Appreciates detailed guides with examples and patterns

## üìö Project Context & Background

### Project: Calm Couples
- **Role**: Creator, Product Lead, Engineering Lead
- **Stack**: React 19 + TypeScript + Supabase + Tailwind CSS
- **Goal**: Relationship wellness platform with gamification
- **Status**: MVP complete, moving toward production

### Related Projects
- **calm/api**: Larger monorepo with established patterns
- **calm/ios-automation**: Tool Cory has in GitHub (mentioned but not used for backend work)

### Key Features Implemented
- 3D plant system (rose, tulip, sunflower, oak)
- Isometric FarmVille-style garden
- Race condition fixes with atomic operations
- GDPR compliance
- Partner connection system

---

## üí° Decisions Made

### Technical Decisions

**Race Condition Fixes** (Session 1):
- ‚úÖ Implement atomic petal increments via RPC
- ‚úÖ Add optimistic locking with version numbers
- ‚úÖ Create daily activity limit enforcement (5/day)
- ‚úÖ Add Supabase realtime subscriptions
- ‚ùå Rejected using iOS automation for backend database issues (pragmatic choice)

**Testing Strategy** (Session 1):
- Created 10 unit tests with mocks (don't require database)
- Created 8 integration tests (require migrations)
- Integration tests skip by default with env var
- All 63 tests must pass before considering work complete

**Code Quality** (Session 2):
- Replace all console statements with structured logger
- Follow calm/api PR #13684 patterns for AGENTS.md
- Create comprehensive documentation for AI agents
- Track technical debt systematically

### Architectural Decisions

**State Management**:
- Use Zustand for global state (already in place)
- Never bypass the store - always use store actions
- Persist state to localStorage where appropriate

**Database Operations**:
- Always use atomic RPC functions for concurrent operations
- Never do read-modify-write patterns in application code
- Use optimistic locking for shared resources (plants)

**Deployment**:
- Migrations applied via Supabase SQL Editor
- Manual application preferred over CLI when CLI requires interactive login

## üîç Things Cory Discovered/Found

### Issues Found

**Race Conditions** (Session 1):
- Petal balance read-modify-write bug
- Daily activity limit bypass (check-then-act)
- Shared plant concurrent updates (no optimistic locking)
- No real-time sync (5-minute stale data)
- 9 total critical concurrency issues identified

**Code Quality Issues** (Session 2):
- 19 console statements across 7 files (should use logger)
- 19 TODO comments (need prioritization)
- 17 TypeScript compilation errors (non-blocking but should fix)
- Missing database indexes for performance

**Missing Features** (Session 2):
- Stripe integration (placeholders only)
- Partner invite emails (mock implementation)
- Error tracking (Sentry not integrated)
- Growth activity tracking (shows TODOs)
- Actual streak calculation (hardcoded to 0)

### Patterns Cory Likes

**From calm/api PR #13684**:
- AGENTS.md files for AI agent guidance
- Structured documentation at multiple levels (root, src, docs)
- Architecture snapshots with data flow diagrams
- Critical patterns sections
- Testing patterns with examples
- Common pitfalls and solutions

**Code Organization**:
- Clear directory structure
- Separation of concerns (components, pages, lib)
- Type-safe throughout (strict TypeScript)
- Comprehensive test coverage

---

## üìä Metrics & Standards

### Quality Bars

**Test Coverage**:
- Current: 63 tests passing
- Target: 98% coverage
- Zero tolerance for failing tests

**TypeScript**:
- Strict mode enabled
- Zero `any` unless absolutely necessary
- All interfaces in `src/types/index.ts`

**Performance**:
- First Contentful Paint: <1.5s ‚úÖ
- Time to Interactive: <3s ‚úÖ
- API Response Time: <200ms ‚úÖ
- Bundle Size: <500KB ‚úÖ

**Code Quality**:
- ESLint: Zero warnings
- Prettier: Auto-formatted

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Preferences

### Development Tools

**Preferred**:
- Supabase SQL Editor (for migrations)
- npm test (for running tests)
- TypeScript strict mode
- Structured logger over console

**Available but not always used**:
- Supabase CLI (requires interactive login, opted for SQL Editor)
- GitHub CLI (gh command)
- calm/ios-automation (GitHub tool)

### Testing Approach

**Unit Tests**:
- Use mocks and response queues
- Don't require database
- Fast and reliable
- Run on every commit

**Integration Tests**:
- Skip by default (env var)
- Require migrations applied
- Test actual database functions
- Run manually when needed

---

## üéì Learning Patterns

### How Cory Learns Best

**Comprehensive Documentation**:
- Detailed guides with examples
- Architecture diagrams
- Common pitfalls section
- Multiple levels (overview ‚Üí detailed)

**Structured Information**:
- Prioritized lists (P0, P1, P2, P3)
- Time estimates for tasks
- Clear success criteria
- Progress tracking

**Practical Examples**:
- Code snippets with explanations
- Before/after comparisons
- ‚ùå Wrong / ‚úÖ Correct patterns
- Real-world scenarios

---

## üí¨ Communication Style

### What Works

**Concise Updates**:
- Brief summaries with key points
- Progress indicators (‚úÖ ‚ö†Ô∏è üöß)
- Clear next steps
- Markdown formatting for readability

**Proactive Problem Solving**:
- Identify issues before being asked
- Propose solutions with rationale
- Execute autonomously when direction is clear
- Report back with results, not ask for permission

**Structured Output**:
- Tables for comparisons
- Bullet points for lists
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Clear section headers

### What to Avoid

**Over-explaining**:
- Don't need detailed justifications for every decision
- Trust is established - execute confidently
- Report outcomes, not every step

**Asking for Permission**:
- "do next todo" means keep going
- Handle blockers gracefully (move to next task)
- Use judgment on priorities

**Leaving TODOs**:
- "do this yourself" means complete it
- No placeholders or "we'll do this later"
- Finish implementations fully

---

**Answer**: No - complete the implementation fully

**Question**: "Can I skip tests if they're broken?"
**Answer**: No - fix them, 63/63 passing is the standard

**Question**: "Should I explain every step?"
**Answer**: No - report outcomes, not process

**Question**: "What if I'm blocked?"
**Answer**: Move to next actionable task (see: logger migration when migrations blocked)

**Question**: "How much documentation?"
**Answer**: Comprehensive is good (see: AGENTS.md as example)
