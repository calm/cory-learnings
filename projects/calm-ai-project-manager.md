# Cory Learnings - GitHub Copilot Optimized

*Last updated: October 31, 2025*

This document captures key insights, preferences, patterns, and learnings from working with Cory Weinstein on the Calm AI Project Manager. **Optimized for GitHub Copilot in VS Code.**

## 🎯 Quick Copilot Context

**Project**: AI-powered project management (Node.js + Express + Prisma + SQLite)  
**Port**: http://localhost:3000  
**AI**: Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet (optional, graceful degradation)  
**Status**: Production-ready v1.5.0 with 105+ tests

## 🤖 GitHub Copilot Optimization

### Code Completion Patterns

**Controller Pattern** (Copilot learns this fast):
```javascript
// Type: "exports.create" and Copilot will suggest:
exports.createTask = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { title, description, priority = 'MEDIUM' } = req.body;
    const task = await prisma.task.create({
      data: { title, description, priority, userId: req.user.id }
    });
    res.status(201).json({ task });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating task:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to create task', details: error.message });
  }
};
```

**AI Graceful Degradation** (High-frequency pattern):
```javascript
// Type: "const { isAIAvailable" and Copilot completes:
const { isAIAvailable, requireAI } = require('../../lib/ai');

if (!isAIAvailable()) {
  return res.status(503).json({
    error: 'AI features unavailable',
    message: 'Natural language processing requires a valid ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'
  });
}
```

**Prisma Queries** (Common patterns):
```javascript
// Type: "const tasks = await prisma.task.find" for:
const tasks = await prisma.task.findMany({
  where: { status: 'IN_PROGRESS' },
  include: { assignee: true, project: true },
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }
});
```

### VS Code Snippets for Cory's Patterns

Add to VS Code `javascript.json` snippets:

```json
{
  "Calm Controller Method": {
    "prefix": "calm-controller",
    "body": [
      "exports.$1 = async (req, res) => {",
      "  try {",
      "    $2",
      "    res.json({ $3 });",
      "  } catch (error) {",
      "    console.error('Error $4:', error);",
      "    res.status(500).json({",
      "      error: 'Failed to $4',",
      "      details: error.message",
      "    });",
      "  }",
      "};"
    ]
  },
  "Calm AI Check": {
    "prefix": "calm-ai-check",
    "body": [
      "const { isAIAvailable, requireAI } = require('../../lib/ai');",
      "",
      "if (!isAIAvailable()) {",
      "  return res.status(503).json({",
      "    error: 'AI features unavailable',",
      "    message: 'Natural language processing requires a valid ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'",
      "  });",
      "}",
      "",
      "const anthropic = requireAI();"
    ]
  }
}
```

### File Templates for Copilot

**New Controller Template**:
```javascript
// Start typing this and Copilot will complete the rest:
const prisma = require('../../lib/db');

exports.list = async (req, res) => {
  // Copilot completes with try-catch pattern
```

**New Route Template**:
```javascript
// Copilot recognizes this Express pattern:
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const controller = require('../controllers/');

// Copilot suggests CRUD routes automatically
```

### VS Code Settings for Optimal Copilot Performance

Add to VS Code `settings.json` for this project:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.advanced": {
    "length": 500,
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "top_p": 1,
    "stops": {
      "*": ["\n\n\n"]
    }
  },
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "*": true,
    "yaml": true,
    "plaintext": false,
    "markdown": false
  },
  "editor.inlineSuggest.enabled": true,
  "editor.suggestSelection": "first",
  "typescript.suggest.autoImports": true,
  "javascript.suggest.autoImports": true,
  "emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "javascript": "javascriptreact"
  }
}
```

### GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code

**Important**: In Visual Studio Code, use the **chat icon with the sparkle** for GitHub Copilot chat functionality. This is the dedicated Copilot chat interface, not the regular chat icon.

**Location**: Look for the sparkling chat icon in the VS Code activity bar (left sidebar) - this opens the GitHub Copilot Chat panel for enhanced AI assistance during development.

### Zen Mode Preference

**Cory Preference**: Likes working with window in Zen mode (View → Appearance → Zen Mode, or `⌘K Z`)
- Removes distractions and provides full focus on code
- Clean, immersive coding experience
- Toggle Zen mode with `⌘K Z` keyboard shortcut

### Project-Specific Copilot Configuration

**File Associations** (helps Copilot understand context):
```json
{
  "files.associations": {
    "*.controller.js": "javascript",
    "*.routes.js": "javascript", 
    "*.service.js": "javascript",
    "*.test.js": "javascript",
    "prisma.schema": "prisma"
  }
}
```

**Copilot Workspace Trust**:
- Enable Copilot for `/calm-ai-project-manager/` directory
- Add to trusted workspaces for enhanced suggestions
- Configure Copilot to learn from `prisma/schema.prisma` for database context

---

## Session Overview

**Context**: This session continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. We built comprehensive project management features with AI integration.

---

### Cory's Working Style

### Preferences
1. **"Keep localhost running"** - Prefers to keep the server running while working on new features
2. **"Do next thing you pick"** - Trusts AI judgment on feature prioritization
3. **"Be critical and continue"** - Values critical analysis and continuous improvement
4. **"Make updates for around 20 minutes"** - Gives clear time boxes for work sessions
5. **"Push changes if needed - have versioning"** - Values version control and semantic versioning
6. **"Save money wherever possible"** - Always consider cost optimization and efficiency in implementations

### Cory's Communication Triggers (for Copilot to recognize)

**Action Triggers**:
- `"do it"` → Full approval, implement immediately
- `"keep localhost running"` → Don't restart server, work on features  
- `"be critical"` → Provide honest assessment, find improvements
- `"do next thing you pick"` → Trust AI/Copilot judgment on priorities
- `"continue"` → Keep working on current task
- `"keep going"` → Make progress, maintain momentum

**Workflow Triggers**:
- `"make updates for around 20 minutes"` → Time-boxed work session
- `"push changes if needed"` → Version control and semantic versioning expected
- `"verify we have functionality"` → Check against external examples/PRs

### Response Patterns for Copilot

```javascript
// When Cory says "do it", Copilot should suggest implementations like:
exports.implementFeature = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Immediate implementation without asking for clarification
    const result = await prisma.model.create(req.body);
    res.json({ result });
  } catch (error) {
    // Always include error handling
  }
};
```

---

## Key Requests & Decisions

### Session Start
**Request**: "keep localhost running - but work on next thing"
- Keep development server active (localhost:3000)
- Continue with next feature development
- Don't interrupt the workflow

### Feature Requests

#### 1. **Fix UI Errors** (Immediate Priority)
Cory showed browser console errors:
```
14:26:09.834 inject.bundle.js:1 Uncaught Error: Automatic publicPath is not supported
14:26:10.108 :3000/api/health:1 Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)
14:26:10.259 :3000/favicon.ico:1 Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)
14:26:25.165 :3000/api/v1/conversation/chat:1 Failed to load resource: 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

**Actions Taken**:
- Fixed 500 errors on AI endpoints (graceful degradation)
- Added /api/health endpoint
- Created functional UI (public/index.html)

#### 2. **Knowledge Base Features**
Cory explicitly requested:
- "LLM slack workflow creation thing"
- "AI tools directory - see what AI tools the company uses, maybe add reviews or something"
- "PTL Checklist - maybe a confluence integration"
- "Easy to use FAQ"
- "Add features you think teams would like"

**Actions Taken**:
- Built AI Tools Directory with reviews and ratings
- Built FAQ System with search and voting
- Built Slack Workflows with LLM-powered generation
- Added PTL Checklist system with Confluence placeholder

#### 3. **Team Wellness Features**
When I suggested 5 wellness features, Cory said:
**"do it"**

This meant:
- Full approval to implement
- No need to clarify details
- Trust the proposed design

**Features Built**:
1. Celebration Board
2. Team Mood/Energy Tracking
3. 1-on-1 Agenda Tracker
4. Decision Log
5. Kudos System

#### 4. **Task Board View** (Latest Request)
**Request**: "have feature - allow user to easily view all work in development and backlog and be able to edit"

**What Cory Wants**:
- Easy visualization of all work grouped by status
- See tasks in BACKLOG, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, REVIEW, DONE
- Ability to edit tasks inline (update status, priority, assignee)
- Kanban-style board view

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Created GET /api/v1/tasks/board/view endpoint
- ✅ Returns tasks grouped by status with stats
- ✅ Shows counts by status and priority
- ✅ Supports optional project filtering (?projectId=xxx)
- ✅ Built full UI with kanban board view

**Additional Context**:
- Cory said "keep improve the cory file" - wants this file kept up to date
- Values having a reference document of what's been learned/requested

#### 5. **Comprehensive UI with Dedicated Views** (Latest Update)
**Request**: "click 'view all teams' 'view all...' etc should have its on ux and ui"

**What Cory Wants**:
- Each "view all" section needs proper UI, not just JSON dumps
- Dedicated views for Teams, Checklists, Knowledge, Wellness, etc.
- Navigation between sections
- Professional UX with proper layouts

**Actions Taken**:
- ✅ Created full single-page app with tabbed navigation
- ✅ 7 main sections: Overview, Tasks, Teams, Checklists, Knowledge, Wellness, Health
- ✅ Kanban board for tasks with status columns
- ✅ List views for teams, checklists, etc.
- ✅ Stats cards showing key metrics
- ✅ Color-coded priority badges
- ✅ Status-colored borders (BLOCKED=red, DONE=green, etc.)
- ✅ Empty states for sections with no data
- ✅ Hover effects and visual feedback
- ✅ Responsive design

**UI Features**:
- **Overview Tab**: Dashboard with 6 key stats (total tasks, in progress, blocked, done, AI status, server status)
- **Tasks Tab**: Full kanban board showing all 20 tasks organized by status (BACKLOG, READY, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, REVIEW, DONE)
- **Teams Tab**: List of all teams with member counts
- **Checklists Tab**: PTL checklists with completion percentages
- **Knowledge Tab**: AI tools directory, FAQs count, workflows count
- **Wellness Tab**: Celebrations, kudos, mood check-ins
- **Health Tab**: System status and feature availability

**Design Patterns Used**:
- Clean, modern design with Calm's purple gradient header
- Card-based layouts for stats
- Grid layouts for board columns
- List layouts for items
- Color coding for priorities (URGENT=red, HIGH=yellow, MEDIUM=blue, LOW=green)
- Status borders on task cards
- Smooth hover transitions
- Empty states with icons

### Documentation Standards

#### 6. **AGENTS.md Documentation**
**Request**: "verify we have functionality from https://github.com/calm/api/pull/13684"

**Context**: PR #13684 added AGENTS.md files throughout calm/api to help AI agents understand the monorepo.

**Key Insights**:
- Calm uses comprehensive AGENTS.md files for AI agent guidance
- Documentation follows specific patterns:
  - Architecture overview
  - Common commands and PR checklist
  - Code style guidelines
  - Database schema documentation
  - API endpoints reference
  - Queue consumers and crons
- README.md should follow specific format:
  - Last updated timestamp
  - Core components with Mermaid diagrams
  - Relevant database tables
  - API endpoints with authentication details
  - Queue consumers and crons sections

**Actions Taken**:
- Created comprehensive AGENTS.md following calm/api patterns
- Updated README.md with proper format
- Added .env.example with all future integrations
- Bumped version to 1.1.0 with better package.json

---

## Technical Preferences & Patterns

### Database
- **Primary**: SQLite for development (zero config, easy reset)
- **Production**: Ready for PostgreSQL migration
- **ORM**: Prisma with TypeScript types
- **Migrations**: Sequential, descriptive names, backwards compatible

### AI Integration
- **Provider**: Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Pattern**: Graceful degradation - core features work without AI
- **Error Handling**: Return 503 with helpful messages when AI unavailable
- **Philosophy**: AI enhances but never blocks functionality
- **Cost Optimization**: Always consider API call efficiency and token usage

### Code Organization
- Controllers handle HTTP and business logic
- Routes define endpoints
- Services contain complex business logic
- Middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- All errors logged with context

### Git Practices
- **Commit Format**: Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- **Attribution**: Include Claude Code attribution in commits
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning (v1.1.0, v1.2.0, etc.)
- **Descriptive Messages**: Include what, why, and impact

- 99+ database models
- Complex subscription system (Stripe, App Store, Play Store, etc.)
- Multiple integrations (Auth0, Slack, Salesforce, etc.)
- Service-oriented architecture
- Rush monorepo management
- Comprehensive testing and validation

### Key Calm Patterns
1. **Error Handling**: Use CalmError with specific codes
2. **Validation**: @calm/simpler-models for schema validation
3. **Promises**: @calm/promises instead of Promise.all
4. **Documentation**: AGENTS.md files for AI guidance
5. **README Format**: Specific sections (Core Components, Database Tables, API Endpoints, Queue Consumers, Crons)

## 🔧 VS Code Auto-Approve Settings Verification

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED WORKING ACROSS ALL PROJECTS

### Auto-Approve Status by Project

| Project | Settings File | File Auto-Approve | Status | Last Tested |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| **calm-ai-project-manager** | ✅ Present | ✅ Configured | ✅ Working | Oct 31, 2025 |
| **calm-couples** | ✅ Present | ✅ Configured | ✅ Working | Oct 31, 2025 |
| **ios-automation** | ✅ Present | ✅ Configured | ✅ Working | Oct 31, 2025 |
| **ios-workspace** | ✅ Present | ✅ Configured | ✅ Working | Oct 31, 2025 |
| **ios** | ⚠️ Basic settings | ❌ Not configured | ❌ Manual approval needed | Oct 31, 2025 |
| **sync-app** | ⚠️ Basic settings | ❌ Not configured | ❌ Manual approval needed | Oct 31, 2025 |
| **web** | ⚠️ Basic settings | ❌ Not configured | ❌ Manual approval needed | Oct 31, 2025 |

### Auto-Approve Configuration

**Fully Configured Projects** have these settings:

```json
{
  "chat.tools.file.autoApprove": {
    "read": true,
    "write": true,
    "create": true,
    "edit": true,
    "search": true,
    "grep": true,
    "list": true
  },
  "chat.tools.terminal.autoApprove": {
    "npm": true,
    "curl": true,
    "grep": true,
    // ... safe commands
    "git": false,  // Still requires approval
    "rm": false,   // Still requires approval
    "sudo": false  // Still requires approval
  },
  "chat.tools.workspace.autoApprove": true,
  "chat.tools.semantic.autoApprove": true
}
```

### Tab Behavior Settings (Anti-Annoyance)

**Added to prevent unwanted VS Code tabs**:

```json
{
  "workbench.editor.enablePreview": false,
  "workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromQuickOpen": false,
  "workbench.editor.enablePreviewFromCodeNavigation": false,
  "workbench.editor.revealIfOpen": true,
  "workbench.editor.focusRecentEditorAfterClose": true,
  "workbench.editor.restoreViewState": true
}
```

### Test Results

**File Creation Tests** (all auto-approved):
- ✅ `/calm-ai-project-manager/test-auto-approve.txt` - No "Keep" button
- ✅ `/calm-couples/test-auto-approve.txt` - No "Keep" button  
- ✅ `/ios-automation/test-auto-approve.txt` - No "Keep" button
- ✅ `/ios-workspace/test-auto-approve.txt` - No "Keep" button

### Key Benefits

1. **No More "Keep" Buttons** - File operations auto-approved in configured projects
2. **No More Preview Tabs** - Files open in persistent tabs instead of temporary previews  
3. **Smart Tab Reuse** - Existing tabs get focus instead of creating duplicates
4. **Safety Maintained** - Dangerous commands (git, rm, sudo) still require approval

### Troubleshooting

If you still see "Keep" buttons:
1. **Check project** - Only 4 main projects have auto-approve configured
2. **Reload VS Code** - Settings may need reload to take effect
3. **Check operation type** - Some operations may still require approval by design
4. **VS Code version** - Ensure you're using a recent version with chat.tools support

### Projects Needing Configuration

**Legacy projects without auto-approve**:
- `ios/` - Basic VS Code settings (March 2023)
- `sync-app/` - Basic VS Code settings (July 2021)  
- `web/` - Basic VS Code settings (February 2025)

**Recommendation**: Add auto-approve settings to these projects if actively used.
