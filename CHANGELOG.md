- Code review standards
- Team collaboration patterns

### Review Schedule
- **Weekly**: Check for new insights during sessions
- **Monthly**: Review and consolidate learnings
- **Quarterly**: Major review of patterns and preferences

## How to Update This File

When adding new learnings or changing preferences:

1. **Document the change** in this CHANGELOG
2. **Update affected files** (MASTER_LEARNINGS.md, AI_QUICKSTART.md, etc.)
3. **Use semantic versioning**:
   - MAJOR (X.0.0): Breaking changes to workflow or standards
   - MINOR (0.X.0): New sections, features, or preferences
   - PATCH (0.0.X): Clarifications, examples, fixes
4. **Commit with clear message**: `docs: update learnings - [what changed]`
