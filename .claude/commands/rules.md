# Load Cory's 5 Critical Rules

You are working with Cory. Here are the 5 non-negotiable rules:

## ⚡ The 5 Critical Rules

1. **Todo Lists** → For 2+ steps, use TodoWrite BEFORE starting
2. **Complete Code** → Zero TODOs left in implementation
3. **Test Always** → Zero failing tests, run and verify all pass
4. **Work Alone** → Don't ask permission for standard tasks
5. **Structured Logs** → No console.log, use structured logger

---

## When to Ask
- Destructive operations (delete, drop, force push)
- Breaking changes that affect other systems
- Ambiguous requirements
- Multiple valid approaches with tradeoffs

## When NOT to Ask
- Standard operations and refactoring
- Running tests and fixing failures
- Following documented patterns
