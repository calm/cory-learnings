# Cost Tracking Dashboard Guide

Real-time visualization of token usage and costs across all projects. Helps you stay within budget and identify cost optimization opportunities.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Dashboard

```bash
# From cory-learnings directory
node cost-tracking-dashboard.js

# Or from anywhere (if added to PATH)
cost-tracking-dashboard
```

Opens dashboard at: **http://localhost:5000**

### 2. Log Token Usage

```bash
# From anywhere
token-tracker.sh log <project> <task> <tokens>

# Examples:
token-tracker.sh log calm-ai-pm "Add AGENTS.md" 3500
token-tracker.sh log qa-automation "Fix flaky test" 2800
token-tracker.sh log calm-couples "Plant renderer fix" 2100
```

### 3. View Dashboard

Go to **http://localhost:5000** in your browser. Dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.

## Dashboard Features

### üìä Summary Cards

- **Total Cost** - Total $ spent across all logged tasks
- **Total Tokens** - Total tokens consumed
- **Tasks Logged** - Number of tasks tracked
- **Avg Cost/Task** - Average cost per task

### üìà Costs by Project

Table showing breakdown by project:
- Number of tasks
- Total tokens used
- Total cost
- Average tokens per task

**Use this to**: Identify which projects consume most budget

### üéØ Top Tasks by Cost

Top 15 tasks ranked by cost:
- Which projects used this task type
- Task count and total cost
- Helps identify expensive workflows

**Use this to**: Find optimization opportunities (e.g., "Feature creation" costs too much)

### üìÖ Costs by Date

Last 30 days of spending:
- Date
- Number of tasks that day
- Tokens and cost for that day

**Use this to**: See spending trends and identify high-cost days

### üìù Recent Activity

Last 20 logged tasks with full details:
- Exact timestamp
- Project
- Task description
- Tokens and cost

**Use this to**: Track what was just logged and spot patterns

  "byTask": { ... }
}
```

### `/api/logs`

```

Response:
```json
["calm-ai-pm", "qa-automation", "calm-couples"]
```

## Logging Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO

1. **Log after task completion**
   ```bash
   # When task is done
   token-tracker.sh log calm-ai-pm "Fix N+1 query" 3200
   ```

2. **Use descriptive task names**
   ```bash
   # Good - specific and actionable
   token-tracker.sh log qa-automation "Fix modal dismissal timeout" 2800

   # Avoid - too vague
   token-tracker.sh log qa-automation "Fix bug" 2800
   ```

3. **Be honest with token counts**
   ```bash
   # Use actual tokens from Claude usage
   # Check: session token counter or from previous session summary
   token-tracker.sh log calm-couples "Plant 3D rendering" 4500
   ```

4. **Log real work sessions**
   ```bash
   # After bug fix
   token-tracker.sh log calm-ai-pm "Debug rate limiting issue" 5600

   # After feature
   token-tracker.sh log calm-ai-pm "Implement cost dashboard" 8200
   ```

### ‚ùå DON'T

1. **Don't log exploratory work**
   ```bash
   # Avoid - unless it leads to actual change
   token-tracker.sh log calm-couples "Research styling options" 2100
   ```

2. **Don't log partial work**
   ```bash
   # Avoid - log when done, not mid-work
   token-tracker.sh log qa-automation "Work in progress" 3000
   ```

3. **Don't exaggerate token counts**
   ```bash
   # Avoid - inflate numbers
   token-tracker.sh log calm-ai-pm "Small fix" 10000  # Actually 2000
   ```

## Understanding Costs

### Token Pricing (Haiku 4.5)

```
Input:  $0.80 per 1M tokens
Output: $2.40 per 1M tokens
Ratio:  ~1:3 (input:output)
```

### Cost Calculation

```
tokens * 0.0026 / 1000 = cost in dollars

Example: 3500 tokens
3500 * 0.0026 / 1000 = $0.0091 ‚âà $0.01
```

### Real Examples

| Task | Tokens | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| Simple bug fix | 2,000 | $0.01 |
| Feature addition | 5,000 | $0.01 |
| Large feature | 15,000 | $0.04 |
| Device debugging | 12,000+ | $0.03+ |
| Full refactor | 18,000 | $0.05 |

---

## Tracking & Analysis

### Daily Budget Check

```bash
# See today's spending
token-tracker.sh today

# Get breakdown by project
token-tracker.sh project

# Estimate cost for X tokens
token-tracker.sh cost 50000  # $0.13
```

### Cost Patterns to Watch

| Pattern | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| üî¥ Single task > 10K tokens | Task too expensive | Break into smaller pieces |
| üü° Feature costs 50% more this week | Cost creep | Check for model changes |
| üü¢ Costs trending down | Good optimization | Document what changed |
| üî¥ Device debugging = 30% of budget | Mobile costs high | Plan device work carefully |

### Monthly Review

```bash
# Check last 30 days of spending
# Use dashboard to see trends
# Calculate: totalCost / 30 = daily average
# Plan next month based on patterns
```

Example:
- November total: $87.50
- Tasks: 65
- Daily average: $2.92/day
- Goal for December: Reduce to $2.50/day through optimization

---

## Integration with Projects

Each project README has a "üí∞ Token & Cost Efficiency" section that references:
- Typical task costs for that project
- How to track and optimize
- Real examples
- Baseline goals

**To add to your project**:

1. Check project's README for "üí∞ Token & Cost Efficiency" section
2. Add logging: `token-tracker.sh log <project> <task> <tokens>`
3. View dashboard to verify tracking works
4. Review weekly to identify optimization opportunities

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard won't start

```bash
# Check Node.js is installed
node --version

# Check logs file exists
ls ~/.claude/token-usage.log

# Try with explicit path
node /path/to/cost-tracking-dashboard.js
```

### No data showing

1. Logs haven't been created yet
2. Check `~/.claude/token-usage.log` exists
3. Add a test entry: `token-tracker.sh log test-project "test task" 1000`
4. Refresh dashboard

### Wrong costs displayed

1. Verify token counts are accurate
2. Check `~/.claude/token-usage.log` format (should be pipe-delimited)
3. Look at `/api/logs` endpoint to inspect raw data
4. Manually fix entries in log file if needed (backup first!)

### High cost for small task

Possible causes:
1. Token count was higher than expected (check summary)
2. Device debugging + normal work in same session
3. Multiple attempts/iterations included in count
4. Review the work to see what consumed tokens

---

## Advanced Usage

### Export Data for Analysis

```bash
# Get all logs as JSON
curl http://localhost:5000/api/logs > token-logs.json

# Filter specific project
cat token-logs.json | grep "calm-ai-pm"

# Calculate average by project
curl http://localhost:5000/api/stats | jq '.byProject'
```

### Monitor Spending in Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check if daily spending > $5
STATS=$(curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/stats)
COST=$(echo $STATS | jq '.totalCost')

if (( $(echo "$COST > 5.0" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Warning: Daily spending exceeds $5 ($${COST})"
fi
```

### Track Multiple Sessions

Dashboard reads `~/.claude/token-usage.log` continuously.

To track multiple Claude sessions:
1. Each session's agent should log via `token-tracker.sh`
2. Dashboard aggregates all sessions
3. Use task names to differentiate work (e.g., "Session-1: feature-x")

---

## Rules

1. ‚úÖ Log all significant work (not exploratory)
2. ‚úÖ Use accurate token counts from session summary
3. ‚úÖ Include descriptive task names
4. ‚úÖ Check dashboard weekly
5. ‚úÖ Plan budget based on historical costs
6. ‚ùå Don't speculate on costs
7. ‚ùå Don't log failed/abandoned work
8. ‚ùå Don't round token counts wildly
