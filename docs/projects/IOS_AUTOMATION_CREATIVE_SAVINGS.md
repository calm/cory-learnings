# ios-automation - Creative Cost Reduction Strategies

**Go beyond storage cleanup. Reduce execution costs by 60-80%.**

---

## Opportunity 1: Test Execution Optimization

**Problem:** Tests run sequentially, taking hours
**Cost:** CI/CD billing = $0.008-0.015 per minute

### Current State
- 648 tests total
- Running sequentially: ~3-4 hours per full run
- CI/CD cost per full run: ~$15-30 (at typical rates)
- Weekly: 7 runs × $20 = $140/week = $7,280/year

### Creative Solution: Parallel Execution + Smart Selection

**Strategy 1: Parallel Test Execution (60% faster)**
```javascript
// Current: tests run one-by-one
npm run test:all → 3 hours

// Better: Run tests in parallel
npm run test:all:parallel
// Jest with maxWorkers=4 → 45 minutes
// 4x parallelism ÷ 3 overhead = 3x faster = 1 hour
```

Implementation:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:e2e:parallel": "jest --config=jest.e2e.config.js --maxWorkers=4",
    "test:all:parallel": "npm run test:unit && npm run test:e2e:parallel"
  }
}
```

**Savings: 3 hours → 1 hour = 66% faster = $10/run saved**

**Strategy 2: Smart Test Selection (Only Run Affected Tests)**
```
Current: Always run all 648 tests

Better: Run only tests affected by changes
- File changed: utils/form.js
- Affected tests: Only form-related tests (~40 of 648)
- Cost: 40 tests × 30 sec = 20 minutes instead of 3 hours

Savings: 3 hours → 20 minutes = 90% faster = $14/run saved
```

Implementation:
```bash
# New script: only run tests for changed files
npm run test:affected

# Uses jest --onlyChanged or similar
```

**Strategy 3: Test Caching (Skip Unchanged Tests)**
```
Principle: If test passed last run and code didn't change, skip it

Example:
- Login flow tests (stable, never change)
  Run once per week (passing = no need to rerun)
- New feature tests
  Run every time until passing

Setup:
- Track which tests passed when
- Skip if code for that test unchanged
- Savings: 300 stable tests skipped = 150 min saved per run
```

**Combined Impact:**
```
Before:  648 tests, sequential, 3 hours, $20/run
After:   ~200 affected tests, parallel, 15 min, $2/run
Savings: 90% time reduction = $18 per run = $936/year
```

## Opportunity 2: Test Data & Mock Optimization

**Problem:** Tests create real data in dev environment
**Cost:** Database queries, cloud storage usage, test flakiness

### Solution: Smart Test Data Management

```javascript
// Before: Each test creates real data
test('login works', async () => {
  const user = await db.users.create({ ... }); // Real DB call
  // Test user
  await db.users.delete(user.id); // Cleanup
});

// After: Use in-memory test doubles
test('login works', async () => {
  const mockUser = { id: '123', email: 'test@example.com' };
  mockAuthService.setCurrentUser(mockUser);
  // Test
  // No DB involved = instant + zero cost
});
```

**Savings:**
- Reduce real API calls: 500 tests × 2 calls = 1,000 API calls/run
- Cost: 1,000 API calls × $0.001 = $1/run
- Weekly: $5/week = $260/year

---

## Opportunity 3: CI/CD Pipeline Optimization

**Problem:** Every commit runs full suite (wasteful)
**Cost:** 100+ unnecessary runs per week

### Solution: Tiered Testing Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  fast-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm run test:unit
      - run: npm run test:lint
    # ~2 min, $0.01 cost

  affected-e2e:
    needs: fast-tests
    if: 'fast-tests succeeds'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm run test:e2e:affected
    # ~10 min if changes affect tests, skipped otherwise, $0.08 cost

  full-suite:
    needs: [fast-tests, affected-e2e]
    if: 'github.ref == "refs/heads/main"'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm run test:all:parallel
    # ~30 min on main only, $0.24 cost
```

**Current cost:**
- Every commit: $0.30 × ~20 commits/day × 5 days = $30/week

**After optimization:**
- Most commits: $0.10 (fast tests only)
- Affected: $0.18 (fast + affected e2e)
- Main: $0.54 (full suite)
- Average: $0.12 × ~20 commits = $2.40/week

**Savings: $30/week → $2.40/week = $1,440/year**

---

## Opportunity 4: Test Infrastructure Consolidation

**Problem:** Running Playwright + Jest + Cypress + WebDriverIO
**Cost:** 4 test frameworks, 4× maintenance, 4× dependency bloat

### Solution: Unified Test Framework

Current:
- Playwright (web testing)
- Jest (unit testing)
- Cypress (alternative web)
- WebDriverIO (mobile)

Proposed:
- Jest (unit + web using Jest Playwright plugin)
- WebDriverIO (mobile only - true specialty)

**Savings:**
- Remove Cypress (unused complexity)
- Consolidate Playwright into Jest
- Results:
  - Faster setup (less tool switching)
  - Smaller node_modules
  - Simpler CI/CD
  - Cost reduction: 20% less infrastructure

---

## Opportunity 5: Test Report Optimization

**Problem:** Generating 100+ MB reports after every run
**Cost:** Storage, upload time, CI/CD minutes

### Solution: Conditional Report Generation

```javascript
// Before: Always generate full report
npm run test:all → generate HTML + JSON reports → 100MB

// After: Conditional generation
if (ONLY_UPLOAD_ON_FAILURE) {
  // Pass: No report generated
  // Fail: Generate detailed report
}
// or
if (MAIN_BRANCH) {
  // Only generate reports on main
}
```

**Implementation:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Only save reports if tests fail OR on main branch
npm run test:all

if [ $? -ne 0 ] || [ "$GITHUB_REF" == "refs/heads/main" ]; then
  npm run generate:reports
fi
```

**Savings:**
- Before: ~100 runs/week × 50MB = 5GB/week storage
- After: ~5 failed runs/week × 50MB = 250MB/week storage
- Storage savings: 95% when tests pass

**Cost:**
- S3: 5GB/week → 250MB/week = $180/month → $9/month = $171/month saved
- **Annual: $2,052/year**

---

## Opportunity 6: Device Farm / Emulator Optimization

**Problem:** Running tests on multiple devices = multiple test runs
**Cost:** Cloud device farm billing multiplied by device count

### Solution: Smart Device Matrix

**Current (naive):**
```
Test every test on:
- iPhone 14 Pro
- iPhone 14
- iPhone 13
- iPad Pro
- iPad Air

648 tests × 5 devices = 3,240 test runs
Cost: 3,240 runs × $0.02/run (device farm) = $64.80/run
```

**Smarter approach:**
```
Critical tests (100):
- Run on all 5 devices (detect regressions everywhere)
- 500 test runs = $10

Standard tests (400):
- Run on main device only (iPhone 14 Pro)
- 400 test runs = $8

Low-priority tests (148):
- Run on main device only
- 148 test runs = $3

Total: 1,048 test runs = $21 (vs $64.80)
Savings: 68%
```

**Cost savings: $64.80 → $21 per run = $228/week = $11,856/year**

## Opportunity 7: Test Data Archival & Rotation

**Problem:** Accumulate 7,625 screenshots + test data forever
**Cost:** Storage + retrieval time + backup overhead

### Solution: Intelligent Data Retention

```javascript
// Retention policy:
// - Last 24 hours: Keep all artifacts
// - Last 7 days: Keep failed tests only + 1 per test
// - Last 30 days: Keep failed tests only
// - Older: Delete

// Implementation:
const RETENTION = {
  '0d': { strategy: 'keep-all' },
  '7d': { strategy: 'keep-failed-only', limit: 1 },
  '30d': { strategy: 'keep-failed-only' },
  '30d+': { strategy: 'delete' }
};
```

**Storage impact:**
```
Current: 6GB (all screenshots)
Day 1: 6GB (↓ 0%)
Day 7: 5GB (↓ 17%) - removed old passes
Day 30: 2GB (↓ 67%) - keep only failed
Day 90: 200MB (↓ 97%) - deep archive

Ongoing: ~200MB/month instead of 600MB/month
Savings: 66% monthly storage reduction
```

## Opportunity 8: Dependency Optimization

**Problem:** node_modules = 202MB (8% of project)
**Cost:** Slower installs, larger deployments, backup overhead

### Solution: Prune Unused Dependencies

```bash
# Analyze which are actually used
npm audit --production
npm ls --depth=3

# Remove:
cypress (if not used)
node-tesseract-ocr (if OCR tests disabled)
Old/duplicate packages
```

**Potential:**
- Remove cypress: -30MB
- Remove tesseract (if unused): -20MB
- Deduplicate: -15MB
- Total: -65MB (32% reduction)

**Savings:**
- node_modules: 202MB → 137MB
- Install time: 2 min → 90 sec
- Deploy time: 10% faster
- Backup: Slightly smaller

---

## Opportunity 9: Test Flakiness Reduction

**Problem:** Flaky tests run multiple times (retry logic)
**Cost:** Extra CI/CD minutes per flaky test

### Solution: Root Cause Analysis + Fix

```
If 10 tests fail 5% of time:
- Current: Run test, fail, retry = 2 runs × 10 tests = 20 test runs wasted/week
- Cost: 20 runs × 30 sec = 10 min wasted/week = $0.50/week = $26/year

If you fix all flaky tests to 99.9% pass rate:
- Saves: 26 runs = $1.35/week = $70/year

Seems small but scales:
- 100 flaky tests @ 5% = 500 runs wasted/week = $25/week = $1,300/year
```
