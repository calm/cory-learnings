## Risk Assessment

| Optimization | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Screenshot cleanup | Low | Archive first, verify nothing breaks |
| Parallel tests | Low | Run on branch first, verify results |
| API caching | Low | Add TTL, can disable if issues |
| Claude optimization | Low | Use Haiku for non-critical tasks |
| Jira migration | Medium | Dual-run period, data export first |
| Framework consolidation | Medium | Gradual migration, keep old framework |
| Serverless migration | Medium | Start with non-critical tasks |

**Recommendation:** Start with Low risk items (Weeks 1-3), then assess Medium risk items

## Key Learnings

1. **Don't start with big migrations**
   - Start with API caching + cleanup
   - Build momentum + confidence

2. **Cache everything aggressively**
   - API responses
   - AI prompts
   - Database queries
   - Typical: 60-80% cache hit rate

3. **Batch operations**
   - 20 API calls → 1 batched call
   - Tokens: 1000 → 200
   - Time: 2s → 200ms

4. **Use cheaper models when possible**
   - Haiku vs Sonnet = 73% savings
   - Haiku quality is 95% of Sonnet for most tasks

5. **Monitor and measure**
   - Before/after metrics
   - Track what works
   - Iterate based on results

---

## Bottom Line

- **This week:** 5 hours of work = $2,010/year saved + faster software
- **This month:** 11 hours of work = $4,290/year saved
- **This quarter:** 17+ hours of work = $8,430+/year saved
- **ROI:** Even at $100/hour, payback in ~2-3 months

**Start this week. Pick 2-3 quick wins. Build from there.**
