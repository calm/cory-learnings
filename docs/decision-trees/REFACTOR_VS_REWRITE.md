# Refactor vs Rewrite Decision Tree

**Question**: Should I refactor this code or rewrite it?

---

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Factor | Refactor | Rewrite |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Code size** | <500 lines | >2000 lines |
| **Tests exist** | Yes, good coverage | No/minimal |
| **Bugs are few** | <2 blockers | 5+ blockers |
| **Architecture sound** | Yes | Fundamentally flawed |
| **Time available** | Limited | Plenty |
| **Risk tolerance** | Low | High |

---

## Decision Flowchart

```
Do you understand the current code?
â”‚
â”œâ”€ NO â†’ Ask questions / read code / run tests
â”‚       Then come back to this decision
â”‚
â””â”€ YES â†’ Is the current architecture sound?
         (Does it logically make sense?)
         â”‚
         â”œâ”€ NO â†’ REWRITE
         â”‚       Architecture is broken
         â”‚       (Estimate: 3-5x more time)
         â”‚
         â””â”€ YES â†’ Does it have good test coverage?
                  (>80% tests passing)
                  â”‚
                  â”œâ”€ NO â†’ ADD TESTS FIRST
                  â”‚       Then refactor with safety net
                  â”‚
                  â””â”€ YES â†’ Are there <3 critical bugs?
                           â”‚
                           â”œâ”€ NO (5+ bugs) â†’ REWRITE
                           â”‚                 Too broken to fix
                           â”‚
                           â””â”€ YES â†’ REFACTOR
                                    Fix bugs + improve incrementally
```

## When to REFACTOR

**Conditions** (all must be true):
- Architecture makes sense
- Tests provide safety net
- Bugs are localized, not systemic
- Have time to refactor gradually
- Team understands current code

**Process**:
1. âœ… Run full test suite (establish baseline)
2. âœ… Fix one bug at a time
3. âœ… Run tests after each fix
4. âœ… Commit per logical fix
5. âœ… Gradually improve code quality
6. âœ… Never break existing functionality

**Time estimate**: 20-30% of original build time

---

## When to REWRITE

**Conditions** (any one is true):
- Architecture is fundamentally flawed
- >50% of code has bugs
- Trying to do something the current design doesn't support
- Have enough time to build properly
- Team agrees current approach is wrong

**Process**:
1. âœ… Understand what currently works
2. âœ… Design new architecture
3. âœ… Build skeleton with TODOs
4. âœ… Implement piece by piece
5. âœ… Test thoroughly
6. âœ… Gradually migrate from old to new
7. âœ… Remove old code once confident

**Time estimate**: 80-150% of original build time

## Examples

### Example 1: "This function is 200 lines and hard to understand"
â†’ **REFACTOR**
- Break into smaller functions
- Add tests
- Improve variable names
- Extract common patterns
- Time: 1-2 hours

### Example 2: "The entire database layer has race conditions, data loss bugs, and doesn't support the feature we need"
â†’ **REWRITE**
- Current design is broken
- Affecting multiple systems
- Time: 2-3 days

### Example 3: "This component has 1 layout bug and code style issues"
â†’ **REFACTOR**
- Bug is localized
- Fix in 30 minutes
- Run tests to verify

### Example 4: "We need to support 5 new data types but the schema doesn't allow it"
â†’ **EVALUATE**
- Can you extend schema? â†’ REFACTOR
- Does schema design prevent it? â†’ REWRITE

---

## Hybrid Approach

**Often the best option**:
1. Refactor working parts (keep what's good)
2. Rewrite broken parts (replace what's bad)
3. Test extensively between changes
4. Commit frequently with clear messages

---

## When in Doubt

**Ask yourself**:
- Can I fix it in <2 hours? â†’ REFACTOR
- Will it take >1 day? â†’ REWRITE
- Is the team confident in the fix? â†’ REFACTOR
- Is the team concerned about the approach? â†’ REWRITE

---

## Red Flags (Rewrite signal)

ðŸš© "It would be easier to rewrite than understand"
ðŸš© "Every fix causes 2 new bugs"
ðŸš© "The tests don't work with the architecture"
ðŸš© "Multiple people say it's broken"
ðŸš© "Performance degrades with scale"

---

**Time saved**: Choosing right approach â†’ 2-3 days of wasted effort avoided
