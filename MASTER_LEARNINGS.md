## Core Working Principles

### "Do This Yourself" - Complete Implementations
- **Never** leave TODOs in code - complete implementations fully
- If planning something, implement it completely
- No placeholders or "we'll do this later" - do it now
- Pragmatic over theoretical

### "Be Critical and Continue" - Autonomous Quality Mindset
- Perform thorough analysis before implementing
- Point out issues and fix them proactively
- Don't just follow instructions blindly - think critically
- Continue working autonomously without asking for permission at each step
- Be brutally honest about what's working vs broken

### "Test All and Make Sure OK" - Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive testing is non-negotiable
- Run tests and verify they pass before moving on
- Fix all errors, don't leave broken tests
- Zero tolerance for failing tests

### "Do Next Todo" - Keep Momentum
- Work through task lists without constant check-ins
- Use judgment to handle blocked items and move to next actionable task
- Trust the plan and execute efficiently
- Don't overthink - move to next best thing when blocked

---

## Communication Style

### How Cory Works
- **Direct & Concise** - Says "do it", "keep going", "be critical"
- **Action-Oriented** - Prefers doing over discussing
- **Honest Feedback** - Wants brutal honesty about what's working vs broken
- **Fast Iterations** - Quick cycles, continuous progress
- **Trusts AI Judgment** - "do next thing you pick"

### Key Phrases & Their Meanings
| Phrase | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **"do it"** | Full approval, proceed with implementation |
| **"be critical"** | Wants honest assessment, not sugar-coating |
| **"continue"** / **"keep going"** | Keep working on current task, I trust your direction |
| **"do next todo"** / **"do next thing you pick"** | Work autonomously, trust AI judgment on priorities |
| **"keep localhost running"** | Don't interrupt the dev server |
| **"push changes if needed"** | Version and commit proactively |

### What Works
- **Concise Updates** - Brief summaries with key points, progress indicators (‚úÖ ‚ö†Ô∏è üöß)
- **Proactive Problem Solving** - Identify issues before being asked, propose solutions with rationale
- **Structured Output** - Tables, bullet points, code blocks, clear headers
- **Autonomous Execution** - Execute confidently, report outcomes not every step

### What to Avoid
- Over-explaining - don't need detailed justifications for every decision
- Asking for Permission - "do next todo" means keep going
- Leaving TODOs - "do this yourself" means complete it
- Analysis paralysis - doing > talking
- Hiding broken things - face problems directly

---

## Task Management & Todo Lists

### Todo List Usage - CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

**IMPORTANT**: Cory expects an optimized todo list at the start of every interaction.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Automatic Enforcement

**Configured**: User prompt submit hook in `~/.claude/settings.local.json`

This hook automatically injects a comprehensive reminder before every user message:
```
ü§ñ AUTOMATIC REMINDER:
- If 2+ steps: Create optimized todo list using TodoWrite BEFORE starting work
- "Do this yourself": NEVER leave TODOs in code - complete implementations fully
- "Test all and make sure ok": Run tests, verify they pass - zero tolerance for failures
- "Be critical and continue": Work autonomously, be brutally honest about issues
- Use structured logger (not console.log) for all error/info messages
- Review ~/cory-learnings/MASTER_LEARNINGS.md for Cory's preferences
```

**How it works**:
- Hook runs automatically on every user message
- Reminder is injected into conversation context
- Claude sees all core working principles before responding
- No manual action needed from Cory
- Covers: todo lists, complete implementations, testing, autonomous execution, code quality

**Configuration**:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "user-prompt-submit": "echo '\n---\nü§ñ AUTOMATIC REMINDER:\n- If 2+ steps: Create optimized todo list using TodoWrite BEFORE starting work\n- \"Do this yourself\": NEVER leave TODOs in code - complete implementations fully\n- \"Test all and make sure ok\": Run tests, verify they pass - zero tolerance for failures\n- \"Be critical and continue\": Work autonomously, be brutally honest about issues\n- Use structured logger (not console.log) for all error/info messages\n- Review ~/cory-learnings/MASTER_LEARNINGS.md for Cory'\''s preferences\n---'"
  }
}
```

This ensures Claude **always** follows your core working principles: complete implementations, comprehensive testing, autonomous execution, and optimized todo lists.

### When to Create Todo Lists
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** at the start of any multi-step task
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** when Cory gives a request that involves 2+ steps
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** for complex tasks that require planning
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** when beginning a new session with work to do

### Todo List Standards

**Structure**:
```javascript
[
  {
    "content": "Action verb + specific task",  // "Fix race condition in petal system"
    "status": "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed",
    "activeForm": "Present continuous form"   // "Fixing race condition in petal system"
  }
]
```

**Quality Requirements**:
- üéØ **Specific** - "Fix login bug" not "Fix bugs"
- üéØ **Actionable** - Clear what needs to be done
- üéØ **Complete** - All major steps included
- üéØ **Ordered** - Logical sequence, dependencies respected
- üéØ **Optimized** - No unnecessary items, right level of granularity

### Todo List Workflow

**Start of Interaction**:
1. Understand Cory's request
2. Break down into logical steps
3. Create optimized todo list with TodoWrite tool
4. Mark first item as `in_progress` BEFORE starting work

**During Work**:
- ‚úÖ Only ONE item should be `in_progress` at a time
- ‚úÖ Mark completed IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch)
- ‚úÖ Add new todos if you discover additional work
- ‚úÖ Remove todos that become irrelevant
- ‚úÖ Update list to reflect current reality

**Task Status Management**:
- Mark `in_progress` ‚Üí Start working on it
- Mark `completed` ‚Üí Move to next task immediately
- If blocked ‚Üí Move to next actionable task, don't wait

**Example - Good Todo List**:
```javascript
[
  {"content": "Analyze race conditions in petal increment", "status": "completed", "activeForm": "Analyzing race conditions"},
  {"content": "Implement atomic RPC for petal operations", "status": "in_progress", "activeForm": "Implementing atomic RPC"},
  {"content": "Add optimistic locking with version field", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Adding optimistic locking"},
  {"content": "Create unit tests for concurrent operations", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Creating unit tests"},
  {"content": "Run full test suite and verify 63/63 passing", "status": "pending", "activeForm": "Running full test suite"}
]
```

**Example - Bad Todo List**:
```javascript
[
  {"content": "Fix stuff", "status": "pending"},  // ‚ùå Too vague
  {"content": "Work on database", "status": "pending"},  // ‚ùå Not specific
  {"content": "Tests", "status": "pending"}  // ‚ùå No clear action
]
```

### Why This Matters

**For Cory**:
- Clear visibility into progress
- Understand scope of work
- Track what's done vs what's remaining
- Verify nothing is forgotten

**For Claude**:
- Organized approach to complex tasks
- Don't forget steps
- Track progress systematically
- Show thoroughness and planning

### Special Cases

**Single trivial task** - Don't create todo list
- "Read this file" ‚Üí Just do it
- "What does this function do?" ‚Üí Just answer
- Simple 1-step operations ‚Üí No todo needed

**Complex single task** - DO create todo list
- "Optimize this component" ‚Üí Multiple steps (analyze, implement, test)
- "Fix this bug" ‚Üí Multiple steps (reproduce, fix, test, verify)

**User provides list** - ALWAYS create todo list
- "Do A, B, and C" ‚Üí Todo list with 3 items
- "Here are 5 things to implement" ‚Üí Todo list with 5 items

---

## Code Quality Standards

### Versioning
- Start making important versioning as applicable
- Add version tracking where it matters (optimistic locking, race conditions)
- Semantic versioning for releases (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, v1.2.0)

### Logging
- Prefer structured logger over console.log
- All errors should be structured with component, action, metadata
- Clear error messages with context

### Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation is valued (AGENTS.md pattern)
- Wants AI agents to understand codebase architecture
- Appreciates detailed guides with examples and patterns
- Last updated timestamps
- Mermaid diagrams for architecture

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Use mocks, don't require database, fast and reliable
- **Integration Tests**: Test actual functionality, run manually when needed
- **E2E Tests**: Test real flows, need proper isolation
- All tests must pass before considering work complete

---

## Technical Preferences

### Architecture
- **State Management**: Use Zustand or similar, never bypass the store
- **Database**: Atomic operations for concurrent operations (RPC functions)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, errors logged with context
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript, zero `any` unless absolutely necessary

### Tools & Stack
- **Preferred**: Supabase SQL Editor for migrations, npm test for testing
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Prisma ORM
- **Database**: SQLite (dev) ready for PostgreSQL (prod)
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet (optional, graceful degradation)
- **iOS Automation**: xcrun simctl, IDB, Appium, Tesseract OCR, Vision AI

### Git Practices
- **Commit Format**: Conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- **Attribution**: Include Claude Code attribution
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning
- **Descriptive Messages**: Include what, why, and impact
