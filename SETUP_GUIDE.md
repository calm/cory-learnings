---

## Project Integration

### 1. Create Project Symlinks

Symlinks allow you to access central learnings from each project directory.

```bash
# For each project, create a symlink
cd ~/path/to/your-project
ln -s ~/your-learnings/projects/project-name.md YOUR_LEARNINGS.md

# Verify symlink
ls -la YOUR_LEARNINGS.md
```

### 2. Create Project-Specific Files

```bash
# Create a learnings file for each project
cat > ~/your-learnings/projects/project-name.md <<'EOF'
---
title: "Your Learnings - [Project Name]"
description: "Project-specific learnings"
version: "1.0.0"
last_updated: "2025-10-31"
project: "project-name"
type: "project-learnings"
---

# Your Learnings - [Project Name]

**Purpose**: Track project-specific preferences and learnings

---

## Project Context

### Project: [Project Name]
- **Type**: [Description]
- **Stack**: [Technologies]
- **Port**: http://localhost:[PORT]
- **Status**: [Development stage]

---

## Key Learnings

### [Session Date]
- [Important discovery or decision]
- [Pattern that worked well]
- [Issue encountered and solution]
EOF
```

---

## Claude Code Integration

### 1. Create Auto-Load Script

This script automatically injects your learnings into every Claude Code session.

```bash
# Create scripts directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.claude/scripts

# Create auto-load script
cat > ~/.claude/scripts/auto-load-learnings.sh <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Auto-load learnings into Claude Code sessions
LEARNINGS_DIR="$HOME/your-learnings"

cat <<EOF

---
ðŸ¤– YOUR LEARNINGS AUTO-LOADED:

âœ… CRITICAL RULES:
  â€¢ TodoWrite for ANY 2+ step task
  â€¢ ZERO TODOs in code
  â€¢ Zero tolerance for failing tests
  â€¢ [Add your critical rules]

ðŸ“– Full docs: ~/your-learnings/AI_QUICKSTART.md
---

EOF
EOF

# Make executable
chmod +x ~/.claude/scripts/auto-load-learnings.sh
```

### 2. Configure Claude Code Hook

Add to VS Code settings (`settings.json`):

```json
{
  "claudeCode.hooks.userPromptSubmit": "~/.claude/scripts/auto-load-learnings.sh"
}
```

**Test it**:
1. Open Claude Code in VS Code
2. Send any message
3. You should see your learnings auto-loaded before each message

---

## Optional Enhancements

### 1. Add Validation Scripts

Create `scripts/validate-structure.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Validate repository structure

REPO_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"

echo "Validating structure..."

# Check required files exist
REQUIRED_FILES=(
    "README.md"
    "AI_QUICKSTART.md"
    "MASTER_LEARNINGS.md"
    "TERM_DICTIONARY.md"
)

for file in "${REQUIRED_FILES[@]}"; do
    if [[ -f "$REPO_ROOT/$file" ]]; then
        echo "âœ“ $file exists"
    else
        echo "âœ— $file missing"
        exit 1
    fi
done

echo "âœ“ All required files present"
```

### 2. Add Test Suite

Copy the test suite from cory-learnings/tests/ and adapt for your needs:

```bash
# Copy test framework
cp -r ~/cory-learnings/tests ~/your-learnings/

# Customize for your structure
# Edit tests/*.sh files to match your requirements
```

### 3. Add Search Tools

Create `scripts/search-learnings.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Search across all learnings files

LEARNINGS_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/.." && pwd)"
SEARCH_TERM="$1"

if [[ -z "$SEARCH_TERM" ]]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <search-term>"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Searching for: $SEARCH_TERM"
echo ""

grep -n -i -C 2 "$SEARCH_TERM" \
    "$LEARNINGS_DIR"/*.md \
    "$LEARNINGS_DIR"/projects/*.md
```

### 4. Create CHANGELOG.md

Track your learnings evolution:

```markdown
---
title: "Changelog"
description: "Version history and evolution"
version: "1.0.0"
last_updated: "2025-10-31"
---

cat > ~/your-learnings/projects/new-project.md <<'EOF'
[Use template from above]
EOF

# 2. Create symlink in project
cd ~/path/to/new-project
ln -s ~/your-learnings/projects/new-project.md YOUR_LEARNINGS.md

# 3. Add to MASTER_LEARNINGS.md project contexts
vim ~/your-learnings/MASTER_LEARNINGS.md

# 4. Commit
cd ~/your-learnings
git add .
git commit -m "docs: add new-project learnings"
```

### Adding a New Term

# 1. Open TERM_DICTIONARY.md
vim ~/your-learnings/TERM_DICTIONARY.md

# 2. Add term in appropriate section
### [Term Name]
**Definition**: [Definition]
**Example**: [Example]
**Related**: [Links]

# 3. Commit
git add TERM_DICTIONARY.md

## Tips for Success

### 1. Start Small
- Begin with core files only
- Add complexity as needed
- Don't over-engineer initially

### 2. Be Consistent
- Update learnings after each significant session
- Use semantic versioning
- Keep formatting consistent

### 3. Make It Yours
- Adapt templates to your style
- Use terminology that makes sense to you
- Document what actually helps

### 4. Iterate
- Review what's working
- Remove what isn't useful
- Refine over time

### 5. Share Selectively
- Keep sensitive information out
- Use .gitignore for private notes
- Consider public vs private repos

---

## Troubleshooting

### Symlinks Not Working?

```bash
# Check symlink exists
ls -la ~/path/to/project/YOUR_LEARNINGS.md

# If broken, recreate
rm ~/path/to/project/YOUR_LEARNINGS.md
ln -s ~/your-learnings/projects/project-name.md ~/path/to/project/YOUR_LEARNINGS.md
```

### Auto-Load Not Working?

```bash
# Test script manually
~/.claude/scripts/auto-load-learnings.sh

# Check VS Code settings
code ~/.config/Code/User/settings.json

# Verify hook is configured
grep "claudeCode.hooks" ~/.config/Code/User/settings.json
```

### Git Issues?

```bash
# If you haven't created a remote yet
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-learnings.git
git push -u origin main

# If you need to fix commit messages
git commit --amend -m "new message"

# If you need to reset
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Undo last commit, keep changes
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Set up basic structure**: Create core files
2. **Integrate with Claude Code**: Set up auto-load script
3. **Add first project**: Create symlink and project file
4. **Start documenting**: Begin capturing learnings
5. **Iterate**: Refine as you learn what works
